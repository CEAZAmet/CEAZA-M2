# What is the CEAZA-M2?
Is a prototyping board with a firmware controlled +5V dedicated step-down power supply and controlled Vin pin for CEAZA MEGA system.
The board give you access to some pins as a PCB breadboard format, ready to solder any module or device.
Furthermore the board have a duplicate I/O expansion terminals to give you direct access to any of its pins.
Whith CEAZA M2 board you can easyly integrate any device to CEAZA MEGA system without any other customized board.

## Documentation
A comprehensive documentation for well undertand, use or modify the CEAZA M2 board is available in our Wiki. In adition, we share with you the schematics diagrams, adns Arduino example codes.

## Quickstart guide
Plan your electronic conection to your device, solder the necesay wires to connect your devices in the M2 board.
Install the M2 board in the CEAZA MEGA's bottom, make certain connection throuhg the boards by three 2 x 10 pin header terminals is rigth. Plug the battery and solar panel cables in the respective board terminal. be careful to avoid swap both plugs, due they are the same type of terminals. Connect the CEAZA MEGA main board system to the host PC by mini-USB connector, open the Arduino ide software, select the Arduino Mega board and the correspondign COM port.
Open any of examples scketches and upload to the board.
### WARNING!
Be careful with your breadboard conections due exist a posibility of a shortcircuit of the power supply acces in the breadboard. 
A 1A PTC Resettable fuse is placed in the main electric supply to the board (VIN pin od I/O expansion terminal) for extra electric protection.
